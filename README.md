Privacy Policy:

The game uses GameKit to allow players to see their stat against their friends and other users through Apple Game Center. Through GameKit the following are collected:
	•	A Game Center player identifier
	•	Display names and avatars
	•	Friend lists and recent-player lists (if used)
	•	Achievement and leaderboard data

 These are all managed by Apple under their Game Center privacy policy. Please refer to Apple's privacy policy for Game Center usage.

 Game Center Notes:
 
 1. Data Apple Game Center collects and retains
	•	Game Center friends & play history
Apple keeps a list of your Game Center friends, the other players you’ve played with, and when you played together so it can show you multiplayer invites, leaderboards, and high score notifications.
	•	Friend requests & activity interactions
It also logs interactions like friend requests and other Game Center feature usage (e.g. using the in-game dashboard from Settings).
	•	Nickname, avatar, scores, achievements, subscription state
Your Game Center nickname, profile picture, submitted scores, achievements progress, and Apple Arcade subscription status are stored and visible to other players (globally or just your friends, depending on your sharing settings).
	•	Optional contact-card linking
If a user enables “Help Friends Find You” in Settings, Game Center will link their nickname to their Contacts card—meaning Apple may use the email address and phone number on file to make social matches easier.

2. What this game (via GameKit) can request

With GameKit’s integration and authentication APIs, the game can request the following about the authenticated local player:
	•	player.playerID (an opaque, stable identifier)
	•	player.displayName (the user’s nickname)
	•	player.alias, and if you ask, player.loadPhoto… for their avatar image
	•	Friend list (the game does not call loadFriends…) and recent players (the game does not call recent players via loadRecentPlayers…)  ￼.

These identifiers are not user’s email or real name—they’re Apple-managed tokens and display names. The developer won’t receive their Apple ID or password, nor any other contact info.
